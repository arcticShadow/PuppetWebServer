Puppet Server Setup Scripts
===========================

Making puppet scripts to setup a server with NGINX, Postfix and MariaDB.

Thus far NGINX and Postfix are running. Some more detailed config would be
required for a production server. 

KNOWN BUGS:
  + NGINX vhosts aren't given their Document Roots
